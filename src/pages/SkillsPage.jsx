                I'm fluent in backend development with extensive experience in Java, Python, and C/C++. I've also worked with lower-level languages including Assembly (MIPS), Verilog, and VHDL when the project demands it. Currently, I'm spending my free time diving into React.js—which is exactly what this website is built with.

                On the ML/AI side, I bring full-stack machine learning capabilities: from building and finetuning models from scratch to prompt engineering with LLMs. I'm comfortable across the entire spectrum—whether it's implementing custom architectures or getting the best results from state-of-the-art foundation models.

                Having worked across organizations ranging from 2-person startups to companies with 300,000+ employees, I've developed a strong understanding of how businesses operate at different scales. My experience spans startup consulting, operations management, and most recently, early-stage venture capital.

                Beyond technical execution, I've taken on leadership positions that taught me how to navigate ambiguity, align diverse stakeholders, and drive projects forward in resource-constrained environments. I'm comfortable wearing multiple hats and thrive in settings where I need to bridge technical and business perspectives.

              I especially love roles where I can combine both skillsets—building technically sophisticated products while understanding market dynamics, user needs, and business viability. Whether it's evaluating startups from both a technical and commercial angle, or architecting systems that solve real business problems, I'm energized by work that sits at this intersection.
